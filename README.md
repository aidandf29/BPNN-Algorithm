This is a Python code in Jupyter Notebook format that performs classification using the Iris Flower dataset. The dataset, known as the Iris Flower dataset, is a well-known dataset in machine learning. It consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each species comprises 50 samples, making a total of 150 samples in the dataset. The goal of the classification task is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its measurements.
